## What it is

You can run one coding agent easily.
But the moment you want three project tasks done in parallel - fixes, investigations, plans, audits - you become a tab-juggler: babysitting sessions, copy-pasting context between repos, forgetting which terminal had the failing test.

firstmate flips the model.
You talk to a single agent - the first mate - and it runs the crew for you: spawning autonomous agents in a visible session backend, giving each a clean git worktree, supervising them to completion, and handing you finished PRs, approved local merges, or standalone investigation reports.
For larger fleets, you can opt in to persistent secondmates: second mates that are still ordinary direct reports, but run from their own isolated firstmate homes.

firstmate is not a model, not a harness, not a skill, not an MCP server, and not a CLI.
firstmate is an agent distro for running a crew of agents.
An agent distro is a portable directory of instructions, skills, tooling, policies, and state conventions that turns a general-purpose agent into a specialized one.
There is no app to install: the cloned repo is the distro - `AGENTS.md`, bundled firstmate skills, and helper scripts that any terminal coding agent can follow.
Launching a supported harness inside it instantiates your first mate - and makes you the captain.

## Features

- **One liaison** - you talk only to the first mate; it dispatches, supervises, escalates only real decisions, and reports plain outcomes.
- **A visible crew** - every crewmate works in its own tmux window, experimental herdr/zellij tab, cmux workspace, or Orca terminal you can watch or type into; the first mate reconciles.
- **Disposable worktrees** - each task runs in a clean [treehouse](https://github.com/kunchenguid/treehouse) git worktree, or an Orca-managed worktree when `backend=orca`, so parallel work on one repo never collides.
- **Three task shapes** - ship tasks deliver a change; scout tasks investigate, plan, reproduce, or audit and leave a report; interactive tasks are captain-driven walkthroughs in a hands-off pane where the agent hands the captain each step and leaves a session log.
- **Explicit project modes** - each project ships via `no-mistakes`, `direct-PR`, `direct-push`, or `local-only`, with an optional `+yolo` autonomy flag.
  `direct-push` runs the full no-mistakes pipeline whose own PR and CI steps do not apply on the forge, then pushes the validated branch to `origin`; firstmate opens the pull request itself on forges such as Bitbucket by sourcing its `.env` credentials.
- **Optional secondmates** - opt in to persistent second mates that run from isolated firstmate homes with their own `FM_HOME`, state, projects, and session lock, supervising project clones or a project-less firstmate-repo domain, kept on the primary firstmate version by guarded local fast-forwards and checked for live agent processes at session start.
- **Event-driven, zero-token supervision** - a bash watcher sleeps on the fleet and wakes the first mate only when something needs you; verified primary harnesses also get a turn-end backstop that blocks or follows up on a blind stop when work is under way and supervision is not live.
- **Host-resource awareness** - a slow kernel-wide CPU, memory, and swap sweep reports how many concurrent agents the machine actually supports, warns before a dispatch and at session start, and wakes the first mate when pressure worsens; it only reports, and never stops or sheds work on its own.
- **Optional X mode** - opt in with one local `.env` token so firstmate can answer your public `@myfirstmate` mentions, act on normal reversible mention requests through the same lifecycle as chat requests, acknowledge spawned work, and post up to three public-safe completion follow-ups within seven days for genuine milestones and the final outcome without changing non-X behavior; dry-run preview records would-be replies and dismissals locally before go-live.
- **Guarded by construction** - the first mate is read-only over your projects except for the guarded paths authorized by [hard rule 1](AGENTS.md#1-identity-and-prime-directives), with fleet sync's safe branch pruning remaining part of the fleet-sync exception; crewmates make every project change behind the configured merge authority.
- **Restart-proof** - all state lives on disk and in the active session backend (tmux by hard default, herdr or cmux when selected or auto-detected, zellij/orca when explicitly selected); kill the session anytime and the next one reconciles, including confirmed-dead secondmate agents, and carries on.

Full detail on every feature lives in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- A verified agent harness: Claude Code, Grok, Pi, Codex, or OpenCode.
- Git and the GitHub CLI, authenticated through `gh auth login`.
- tmux, for the reference session backend.

The first mate detects and offers to install everything else.

### Recommended harnesses

**Claude Code, Grok, and Pi are equal co-primary recommendations** for running the primary firstmate session.
Claude Code and Grok use background-notify wake cycles; Pi uses its tracked primary watcher extension.
All three have verified turn-end guard paths when launched with their documented setup.
Pick whichever one matches your subscription and workflow.

Codex and OpenCode are also verified and supported as primary harnesses; Codex uses bounded foreground checkpoints, and OpenCode uses a TUI plugin, so both carry more harness-specific supervision tradeoffs than the three co-primaries.

### Install and launch

```sh
gh auth login
git clone https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate
cd firstmate
```

Then launch one of the co-primary harnesses; AGENTS.md takes over from there:

**Claude Code**

```sh
claude
```

**Grok**

```sh
grok --trust
```

**Pi**

```sh
pi
```

For Grok, `--trust` is needed once per clone so project hooks and the turn-end guard load; `/hooks-trust` inside Grok works too.
For Pi, approve the project trust prompt once per clone on first launch so the tracked `.pi/extensions/*.ts` files auto-load.
Every Pi session starts with calm mode off; `/calm` is a session-local conversation-focused transcript toggle.
While active, it uses Pi's supported presentation APIs to hide the live working row, collapsed thinking labels, all seven built-in tool shells, the Firstmate watcher tool shell, and canonically typed Firstmate operational inputs.
Every injected input remains in model context and session storage.
Inputs that ordinarily render as user rows use a TUI-only custom entry so Calm can hide and restore their presentation without changing delivery; the session-start nudge remains on its existing non-displayed custom-message path.
Toggling off restores ordinary rendering, and `Ctrl+O` expansion behavior stays unchanged.
Tool execution, model context, session storage, diagnostics, and `/export` and `/share` operation remain unchanged; Pi's exporter omits synthetic control inputs because its supported renderer surface cannot preserve their stock user styling without leaving live transcript gaps.
Pi 0.81.1 still exposes no global transcript filter, so expanded reasoning, its reserved spacing, built-in tool images, user-bash rows, skill and summary rows, status notices, and arbitrary custom-tool or extension rows remain supported-API boundaries.
The version-scoped feasibility evidence and complete render taxonomy are recorded in [docs/calm-mode-feasibility.md](docs/calm-mode-feasibility.md).

### Talk to it

```sh
> ahoy! look at my github project xyz, then fix the flaky login test and add dark mode

# firstmate checks its toolchain (asking your consent before installing anything),
# clones the project under projects/, and spawns two crewmates in the active backend
# fm-fix-login-k3 and fm-dark-mode-p7.
# Minutes later:

  PR ready for review, captain: https://github.com/you/xyz/pull/42
  (fix flaky login test - risk: low - CI green)

> alright merge it
```

### More backends

Setup guides for tmux (the default) and every other supported backend (herdr, zellij, Orca, cmux) are linked in [Documentation](#documentation) below.

## How It Works

     │
     └─ scout: report at data/<id>/report.md ► decision inventory ► relay findings ► teardown
```

You chat with the first mate.
It routes each request to a crewmate in its own session endpoint and git worktree, supervises the fleet with a zero-token event-driven watcher, and brings you finished PRs, approved local merges, or investigation reports.
Optional secondmates extend this to persistent second mates, dispatch profiles let you steer which harness handles which task, and an opt-in X mode lets the same fleet answer public mentions.
`codex-app` is not a runtime backend yet; [docs/codex-app-backend.md](docs/codex-app-backend.md) owns the Codex App boundary.

Full architecture - the supervision engine, worktree isolation, secondmates, dispatch profiles, project modes, optional X mode, fleet sync, and self-update - is in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Built-in skills

Firstmate ships these user-invocable built-in skills.
Claude and grok use the slash form shown here; codex uses the same names with `$`, such as `$afk`.

| Skill              | What it does                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/afk`             | Enter away-mode supervision: the sub-supervisor self-handles routine notifications in bash, escalates captain-relevant events and bounded declared-external-wait rechecks as batched digests, and actively alerts if delivery gets stuck while you step away; a session with no pane the sub-supervisor could type into instead runs the daemon with paneless pull delivery through a durable outbox that firstmate's armed reader drains, and only a session with no delivery channel at all enters the away posture with no daemon and keeps its own watcher supervising |
| `/ahoy`            | Recap only visible session events since the prior real captain message, falling back to Bearings when invoked as the session's first real captain message |
| `/bearings`        | Generate a standalone current-status report from bounded local fleet and registered-secondmate state, with live PR enrichment only when requested, written to a dated file in `data/` and surfaced concisely in chat; read-mostly, mutates no task state |
| `/work-report`     | Generate an engineering work-progress report for a chosen timeframe (a named window such as last-week/this-week/last-month, or an explicit `--since`/`--until` range) across the fleet's repos, with three separately-methoded throughput numbers, written to a dated file under `data/` and optionally published as a Lavish surface |
| `/updatefirstmate` | Self-update the running firstmate and its secondmates to the latest from origin with fast-forward-only pulls, then re-read instructions and nudge secondmates |
| `/stow`            | Sweep the session for uncaptured durable knowledge, route each finding to its disk home per AGENTS.md, file undone next steps to the backlog, and report what is now safe to reset |

Agent-only reference skills live under `.agents/skills/` and are loaded by firstmate at the trigger points named in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

### Two-tier skill layout

Firstmate's skills live in two separate places with different audiences:

- `.agents/skills/` - agent-loaded skills (this section's table, plus firstmate's agent-only reference skills). Every one of these assumes a live firstmate home and is meaningless, or actively misleading, installed anywhere else, so each carries `metadata.internal: true` in its frontmatter. That flag hides them from installer discovery (tools like the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) `npx skills add` installer) without affecting how firstmate itself loads them - frontmatter metadata is inert to the agent's own skill loader.
- `skills/` - public, installer-facing skills meant to be installed standalone into any project, independent of firstmate.
  Each one is a self-contained skill with no dependency on firstmate's paths, tools, or vocabulary.
  Today that is `skills/stow`, a generic session-knowledge-sweep skill that routes findings by explicit instruction first, then existing local conventions, then a private `.stow-notes.md` fallback in the current directory, and closes with a resume pointer for the next session.
  It intentionally shares no code with the firstmate-internal `.agents/skills/stow` it is named after, so the two can evolve independently.

## Fork improvements

This fork of [kunchenguid/firstmate](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate) carries the following improvements.

- Verified jcode as a first-class primary harness, crewmate, and secondmate adapter, including a bounded-checkpoint supervision protocol and an async background-notify wake path.
- Added daemon-free away mode: paneless pull delivery of escalations, a resilient inbox reader that self-heals, an autonomous queue driver, and persist-across-session-turnover intent.
- Made teardown release a worktree as soon as its branch is pushed to origin, backed by a durable merge queue of pushed-but-unmerged ship branches and merge-workers-on-demand.
- Fixed the teardown reachability check so commit containment in a surviving default branch counts as landed rather than blocking cleanup.
- Added host resource monitoring (CPU, memory, swap) wired into spawn, the watcher, and session start, plus a fleet memory-attribution report and a language-server reclaim tool.
- Serialized the fleet's heavy runs (test suites, lint, builds) behind a configurable host-global ceiling.
- Added an external liveness watchdog that re-wakes a dead primary and writes a durable escalation when work is in flight.
- Added the captain's desk and backlog LAN views, batched drain-and-arm wake handling, an opt-in present-mode supervision daemon, and present-daemon stale-target fixes.
- Added the direct-push delivery mode for non-PR forges, the +autoland flag for structural green-branch landing, and Bitbucket and GitLab pull/merge request support.
- Classified auth, quota, and token-exhaustion stalls as blocked rather than paused, and added per-pane 429 anomaly detection ahead of a worker surfacing its own block.
- Added per-secondmate harness, model, and effort pins, a crewmate dispatch-profile selector, and a decision-desk value ledger.
- Added the caveman ultra prose rule as a structural fleet rule and baked the standing captain rules into every generated brief.
